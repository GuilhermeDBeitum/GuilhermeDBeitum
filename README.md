</h2>



My specialty is front-end programming.
Committed to the service to be performed, I act in the best possible way, always using good logical reasoning, to try to finalize the implementations without leaving any errors.
I have experience with systems, dashboards, devops methodology and various tools.
I currently work as a freelancer webdev and perform maintenance on computers (hardware and software).
I like to study a lot, to know new programming languages and technologies, I always try to improve myself and keep myself updated.
